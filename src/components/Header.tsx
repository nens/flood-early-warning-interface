          <h4>Terms &amp; Conditions</h4>
          <p>
            Use of the FloodSmart Parramatta System is subject to the terms and
            conditions set out below. If you proceed to use the FloodSmart
            Parramatta System, your use will be taken as acceptance of these terms
            and conditions.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The FloodSmart Parramatta System is provided by City of Parramatta
              Council (Council), as part of a collaborative project between
              Council, Sydney Water Corporation, NSW State Emergency Services and
              Office for Environment and Heritage (together the Project Group).
            </li>
            <li>
              The FloodSmart Parramatta System intends to provide catchment, river
              and rain gauge, modelling and forecast data for information during a
              flood event. The FloodSmart Parramatta System will also provide
              automated alerts to warn of potential flood risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              While Council will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the data
              is provided at the earliest opportunity and is fit for purpose, the
              FloodSmart Parramatta System relies on third party data and predicts
              future events therefore reliability cannot be guaranteed. Use of the
              data contained in the FloodSmart Parramatta System for incident
              response is at the userâ€™s own risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the FloodSmart Parramatta System is subject to naturally
              occurring events, the Project Group does not warrant the accuracy
              and completeness of the information. The FloodSmart Parramatta
              System should not be solely relied upon. You are responsible for
              verifying the information provided by the FloodSmart Parramatta
              System and making your own independent assessment of the risks.
            </li>
            <li>
              While Council will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that any
              FloodSmart Parramatta System alerts are provided to you at the
              earliest opportunity, the FloodSmart Parramatta System relies on
              telecommunication networks to send alerts and the delivery of the
              alerts cannot be guaranteed.
            </li>
            <li>
              You acknowledge that you are using the FloodSmart Parramatta System
